# The endpoint represents the HTTP endpoint for your Prisma API. It encodes
# several pieces of information:
# * Prisma server (`localhost:4466` in this example)
# * Service name (`myservice` in this example)
# * Stage (`dev` in this example)
# NOTE: When service name and stage are set to `default`, they can be omitted.
# Meaning http://myserver.com/default/default can be written as http://myserver.com.
